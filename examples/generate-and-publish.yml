  # Anything uncommented below will also need to be uncommented in the "with" section of the "Generate SBOM" step
  # Choose an SBOM generator from the list below (uncomment one and only one):
  #sbomGenerator: syft
  #sbomGenerator: trivy
  #sbomGenerator: cdxgen
  #sbomGenerator: sigstore-bom
  #sbomGenerator: spdx-sbom-generator
  #sbomGenerator: docker-sbom
  #
  # Choose an SBOM output format from the list below (uncomment one and only one):
  ## NOTE: spdx-json cannot be used with cdxgen or docker-sbom
  #sbomOutput: spdx-json
  ## NOTE: cyclonedx-json cannot be used with sigstore-bom, spdx-sbom-generator, or docker-sbom
  #sbomOutput: cyclonedx-json
  #
  # Optional flags for the generator (uncomment and modify as needed):
  #
  # Relationship is used to describe the relationship of the SBOM to the repository.
  ## For example: if the SBOM is generated from a repository written by your organization, the relationship is "first".
  ## If the SBOM is generated from a repository written by a third party, the relationship is "third".
  ## The line below only needs to be uncommented if the relationship is "third".
  #relationship: third
  #
  # The SBOM name will default to the repository name, which can be overwritten below
  #sbomName: forced-sbom-name
  #
  # Generally the repository path can be found automatically, but if not, it can be set below
  #path: ./
  #
  # Uncomment the following line to skip saving the SBOM as an artifact for this job
  #sbomArtifact: false
  #
  # The SBOM version defaults to environment variable tag or commit hash which can be overwritten below
  #sbomVersion: forced-sbom-version
  # Labels are synonymous with "tags" and can be used to easily identify assets and components within Manifest.
  ## For example:
  ## sbomLabels: "label1,label2,label3"
  ## Uncomment the following line to add labels to the SBOM
  #sbomLabels: <LABELS>
